<h1>Tree</h1>
<h2>Collapsable UI to interact with Nested JSON data</h2> 
<p>This was created as a personal tool that helps me build websites with predictable data storage patterns.</p>
<p>Tree also makes it much easier to push data on to firestore and firebase storage as a developer. </p>
<p>An example website that I used this method: https://www.lwongconsulting.com, in which are projects were added using tree.</p>

<p> The following video shows its usage. If you wish to try it for yourself go to: https://tree-demo-9ae4f.web.app and SignIn with google.</p>
<p> The controls are fairly intuitive I believe, If you wish to create a new property in a Branch doc click the plus. Empty the property for auto delete. </p>
